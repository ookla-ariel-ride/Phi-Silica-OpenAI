# System Patterns — npu-bridge

## Shape
```
NpuBridge (exe, ARM64)          NpuBridge.Core (net10.0, no WinRT)          NpuBridge.Tests
  Program.cs (CLI, host)  --->    Api/        endpoints, OpenAI DTOs, errors     TestServer + FakeBackend
  Backends/PhiSilica*             Backends/   ILanguageModelBackend, Lifecycle, Fake
  PackageActivation.cs            Configuration/ options, binder, CLI, sources
  ServiceCommands/TaskCommands    Hosting/    sc.exe + schtasks builders, identity
  ProcessIdentity.cs              (chunk 3+) Prompting/, Context/, Engine/, Streaming/, Tools/
```
Logic lives in Core so it is testable without the NPU; the exe holds only wiring, WinRT adapters and
Windows-specific glue. Tests boot the real endpoint pipeline in-process.

## Backend contract (`ILanguageModelBackend`)
- `InitializeAsync` once, possibly minutes; `BackendLifecycle` runs it in the background, owns the
  backend, and disposes it only after initialization finishes (grace period for stubborn runtimes).
- `CreateContext(systemPrompt?)` returns an `IModelContext` the caller owns and disposes.
- `GenerateAsync(ctx, prompt, sampling?, onDelta, ct)` streams deltas on an arbitrary thread; returns
  `GenerationResult(Text, Status, Detail)`. Cancellation is `GenerationStatus.Cancelled` with partial
  text, never an escaping exception.
- `Capabilities` flags (SamplingOptions, SystemPromptContext, PromptLengthPreflight, Cancellation) tell
  the pipeline what to branch on. Aion lacks the first three; Phi Silica has all four.
- Status enums are mapped by name per adapter (`Error` is 6 on Phi Silica, 2 on Aion).
- A context whose generation ended in anything but `Complete` is disposed, never reused.

## Fake backend as the contract's executable spec
`FakeBackend` mirrors the runtimes' sharp edges on purpose: deltas on a thread-pool thread, use before
`InitializeAsync` throws, disposal enforced everywhere, per-token/first-token delays, fault injection
(status or exception, at any token including after the last), simulated context window
(`MaxPromptChars`), and full call recording (`Calls`, per-context `History`). Tests that pass against
it should not pass vacuously on the NPU.

## Configuration
One composition (`BridgeConfiguration`): `appsettings.json` < `appsettings.local.json` (secrets,
gitignored) < `NPU_BRIDGE_*` environment (custom source that maps `LAF_TOKEN` → `LafToken`) < command
line (normalised to `Key=value`). The unprefixed environment provider is removed. Server and the
service/task verbs bind through the same code.

## Package identity and process start (Phi Silica)
- Identity comes from a sparse package (`packaging/AppxManifest.xml`, `scripts/identity.ps1`) and is
  granted only by package activation. `Program` relaunches itself through
  `IApplicationActivationManager` when started by path as `phi-silica`; arguments survive.
- Auto-start: logon scheduled task (`task install`) for Phi Silica; Windows service (`service install`)
  for aion/fake. Both build `sc.exe`/`schtasks.exe` command lines in Core with CRT-correct quoting and
  refuse secrets on the command line.
- Windows App SDK auto-bootstrap is off; the adapter calls `Bootstrap.TryInitialize` with
  `OnPackageIdentity_NOOP` and records the outcome in `/healthz`.

## HTTP conventions
- JSON is snake_case, nulls omitted; errors are `{"error":{"message","type","param","code"}}` with
  OpenAI's types (`invalid_request_error` for 404s, `rate_limit_error`, `server_error`).
- `/healthz`: 200 only when ready; 503 with `Retry-After: 10` while loading;
  `first_run_compile_likely` after 60 s; backend diagnostics passed through verbatim.
- `/v1/{**}` fallback: 405 with `Allow` for a wrong method on a known path, otherwise 404.
- `/debug/generate`: raw prompt into the backend with timing; diagnostic only.

## Review loop
Each chunk: build + tests green → adversarial review (in-session subagent, then Codex) → fix in-scope
findings → defer the rest to `docs/FUTURE.md` → append to `docs/DECISIONS.md` → commit.
